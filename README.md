## Motivation
- Be a better developer. I want to be great someday - projects help you learn faster. Daily progress is always win!
- I want to boost my income. I live in the Philippines and it's hard to make a good living here so I've been putting in the work to make a good living for my family and other people. I enjoy and do my best in what I do so why not get paid instead.
- I want to keep myself accountable and encourage others who are doing the same challenge.
- This challenge might give me an opportunity for something big. Who knows?

## Commitment 
### *Outside of work, I will code at least 6 days a week*
